## Task Classification Criteria

Analyze the task and classify it as SIMPLE, MEDIUM, or COMPLEX:

**SIMPLE (low risk, trivial changes):**
- Single-file edits or documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes (typos, obvious errors)
- No cross-module dependencies
- Can be completed in <30 lines of changes
- Low risk of breaking existing functionality

**MEDIUM (moderate complexity, isolated scope):**
- Single feature or bug fix within one domain module
- May require new files but within existing architecture
- Self-contained changes (no ripple effects)
- Moderate risk
- Can delegate to current branch or isolated worktree

**COMPLEX (multi-step, cross-cutting, or architectural):**
- Requires multiple coordinated changes
- Cross-module refactoring or new integrations
- Needs decomposition into logical steps
- High risk or requires incremental PR review
- Benefits from dedicated base branch + sub-PRs

After analysis, present your classification decision with:
- Path chosen (SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX)
- Rationale (2-3 bullets explaining why)
- Execution approach (brief strategy)
