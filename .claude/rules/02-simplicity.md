# Core Principle: Keep It Simple

**DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER.** If the plugin you're building is getting complex, stop and report to the human. You may be overdoing it.

- Start with the minimal viable implementation
- Add complexity only when explicitly needed
- A 20-line script is better than a 200-line framework
- If you need more than 3 files for a simple command, reconsider
