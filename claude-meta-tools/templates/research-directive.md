## Research Requirements

Before implementing or discussing unfamiliar technologies:
1. Research official documentation - never guess based on training data
   - Loaded MCP available → use directly (faster)
   - Need discovery or unsure → `/claude-meta-tools:research [query]`
2. State what sources were consulted
3. Avoid years in web searches - search engines handle recency
