# Testing a plugin from source

How to validate a plugin (skills, permissions, flow) before a release.
Every rule below was paid for during the git-sweep 3.0.0 fusion.

## Launch a test session

```bash
command claude --permission-mode default --plugin-dir <repo>/<plugin>
```

- `command claude`, not `claude`: the owner's shell function injects
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` into every plain `claude` launch, and it
  does not check for `--permission-mode` before doing so.
- `--plugin-dir` reads the plugin source at process launch. No version bump,
  no cache write, no `plugin-cache-sync`.

## Permission modes are not equal tests

- `bypassPermissions` and `auto` (the owner's global `defaultMode: dontAsk`)
  auto-approve; a session in either proves nothing about `allowed-tools`.
  Only `default` mode surfaces the prompts that reveal a coverage gap.
- An "always allow" click persists into `~/.claude/settings.local.json` and
  masks the same gap in every later session. Before concluding that a
  frontmatter fix works, check that file for a grant that covers it.

## Process traps

- `/clear` starts a new session id but keeps the CLI process, and the process
  loaded plugin files at launch. Retesting an edited `SKILL.md` needs a new
  process, not a `/clear`.
- Plant a version marker before retesting: one `Inputs` line whose rendered
  value differs between the old and the new file proves which version loaded.

## Headless conclusive test

```bash
command claude -p --permission-mode default --plugin-dir <plugin> "/<skill> <args>"
```

- `!` preprocessing failures land on stderr before the model runs. Empty
  stderr means the skill's `allowed-tools` covers its `Inputs`.
- In `-p`, a prompt becomes a denial. A full run without one validates the
  allowlist for the whole flow, stronger than an interactive pass.

## Verify through transcripts

Transcripts live at `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`.

- Read the `permission-mode` rows first; a bypass or auto session invalidates
  any permission conclusion drawn from it.
- The rendered `## Inputs` values show whether `!` interpolation ran and which
  file version the process had loaded.

## Skill mechanics worth knowing

- `` !`cmd` `` interpolation works in `SKILL.md`. The permission check walks
  every head of a compound command; its error names the blocking part
  (`test` in `test -f … && echo …`), the rest already passed.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted in `SKILL.md` at load, never in a
  file the model opens with `Read`. Sibling phase files must locate the
  plugin root relative to the skill base directory the harness prints.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` on a skill removes its description from
  model context; commands and model-invocable skills keep theirs loaded in
  every session. Phase files opened with `Read` cost zero standing context,
  which is why git-sweep carries `audit.md`/`apply.md` instead of commands.
- An installed plugin is the source tree copied verbatim into
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`, executable
  bits included. A layout that works under `--plugin-dir` works installed.
